Addressing Your Requirements Concisely
Requirement 1: Concise Output
Understood, I'll keep responses short and to the point.

Requirement 2: C Code Fix Warnings
The errors you’re seeing (COMPRESS: command not found, etc.) aren’t C compiler warnings but issues with your Makefile variables not being defined. These are likely shell variables (COMPRESS, COMPRESS_EXTENSION, SYSCF_FILE, HACKDIR) that need to be set before running make. They’re not being passed correctly to the CFLAGS.

Fix:

Define these variables in your Makefile or shell environment before running make. For example:
bash
Wrap
Copy
export COMPRESS="gzip"
export COMPRESS_EXTENSION=".gz"
export SYSCF_FILE="/path/to/syscf"
export HACKDIR="/path/to/hackdir"
make CFLAGS="-g -O -I../include ..." all
Alternatively, hardcode them in the Makefile if they’re static:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
COMPRESS = gzip
COMPRESS_EXTENSION = .gz
SYSCF_FILE = /path/to/syscf
HACKDIR = /path/to/hackdir
Run make again.
Without seeing the Makefile, I assume these are expected to be defined. If this doesn’t resolve it, please share the Makefile.

Requirement 3: Learn How to Better Program in C
To improve your C skills:

Read: "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie (short, authoritative).
Practice: Solve problems on sites like LeetCode or HackerRank using C.
Debugging: Learn gdb (gdb ./yourprogram, then break, run, next) and use -Wall in CFLAGS to catch warnings early.
Resources: Check MIT’s OpenCourseWare (6.087 Practical Programming in C) for free structured learning.
Start with small projects, focus on pointers and memory management—they’re key.

Requirement 4: Context Request
If I need more context (e.g., Makefile or source files), I’ll ask explicitly.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

Analysis and Fixes
Your Makefile snippet looks mostly fine, but the errors (COMPRESS: command not found, etc.) suggest that the variables aren’t being substituted correctly when make runs. This is likely due to how the CFLAGS are passed or interpreted in the make command. Let’s fix that and address warnings.

Fixing the Errors
Variable Substitution Issue:

Your make command overrides CFLAGS entirely, ignoring the Makefile’s CFLAGS definitions.
The external make CFLAGS="..." command doesn’t expand Makefile variables like $(HACKDIR) before passing them to the compiler.
Solution: Remove the CFLAGS override from your make command and let the Makefile handle it. Use this instead:

bash
Wrap
Copy
make all
The Makefile already defines CFLAGS correctly with HACKDIR, COMPRESS, etc.

Undefined Variables in Original Command:

The original make command references $(COMPRESS), $(COMPRESS_EXTENSION), $(SYSCF_FILE), and $(HACKDIR) without defining them in the shell or command line, causing "command not found" errors.
Since they’re now defined in the Makefile (e.g., COMPRESS=\"/bin/gzip\"), relying on the Makefile’s CFLAGS fixes this.
Addressing Compiler Warnings
Your make command includes -Wmissing-field-initializers -Wextra, which are good for catching issues, but you didn’t share specific warnings. Assuming typical C issues in a NetHack-like game, here’s how to refine:

-Wmissing-field-initializers:
Triggered by incomplete struct initialization (e.g., struct foo f = {0} instead of fully specifying all fields).
Fix: In your C files, ensure structs are initialized fully or use designated initializers (C99+). Example:
c
Wrap
Copy
struct player { int hp; int mp; } p = { .hp = 10, .mp = 5 };
If I had your source files, I could pinpoint this.
-Wextra:
Catches unused variables, implicit conversions, etc.
Fix: Add -Wall to CFLAGS in the Makefile for more coverage and review the output. Example tweak:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS+=-Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers
Updated Makefile Suggestion
Here’s a cleaned-up version of your CFLAGS section to ensure clarity and maintainability:

makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB
CFLAGS += -DCOMPRESS=\"/bin/gzip\" -DCOMPRESS_EXTENSION=\".gz\"
CFLAGS += -DSYSCF -DSYSCF_FILE=\"$(HACKDIR)/sysconf\" -DSECURE
CFLAGS += -DTIMED_DELAY -DHACKDIR=\"$(HACKDIR)\"
CFLAGS += -DDUMPLOG -DDEBUG -DCONFIG_ERROR_SECURE=FALSE
CFLAGS += -DCURSES_GRAPHICS -DSCORE_ON_BOTL
CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers
Next Steps
Run make clean && make all with the updated Makefile.
If warnings persist, share the specific compiler output (e.g., gcc -c file.c ... warnings).
For Requirement 3 (learning C), focus on understanding how preprocessor directives (-D) work—your Makefile uses them heavily.
Let me know if you hit specific warnings!






A lot! of warnings. Is it worth fixing if the program compiles? as for Requirement 3, I was hoping you would help me with that as each problem is identified and resolved.


Should You Fix Warnings If It Compiles?
Yes, it’s worth fixing warnings, even if the program compiles and runs:

Bugs: Warnings often hint at potential runtime issues (e.g., uninitialized variables causing crashes).
Maintainability: Fewer warnings make future debugging easier.
Learning (Requirement 3): Fixing them teaches you C pitfalls and best practices hands-on.
That said, in a large project like NetHack, some warnings (e.g., from legacy code) might be low-priority if the behavior is stable. Prioritize based on severity.

Plan for Warnings + Learning
Since you’ve got "a lot!" of warnings, let’s tackle them iteratively:

Share a small batch (e.g., 5-10 lines of warning output) in your next reply.
I’ll explain each, suggest fixes, and tie it to C fundamentals (Requirement 3).
You apply fixes, recompile, and we repeat.
Example (Hypothetical Warnings)
If you had something like:

text
Wrap
Copy
file.c:10: warning: ‘var’ may be used uninitialized [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
file.c:20: warning: unused variable ‘temp’ [-Wunused-variable]
Fix 1: Initialize var (e.g., int var = 0;). Lesson: Uninitialized variables in C have undefined values—always set them.
Fix 2: Remove temp or use it. Lesson: Unused variables waste memory and clutter code.
Next Step
Post some of your actual warnings, and we’ll dive in. You’ll learn C as we go!






I'm going to make the assumption there are similar and less similar warnings. Let me share all of the warnings and have you cagegorize them. Then I can fix all of the same type of problems at once.
make_errors.asc


Warning Categorization and Fixes
Here’s a concise categorization of the warnings from your make all output, with fixes and C lessons tied to Requirement 3 (learning C). I’ve grouped similar warnings and prioritized those with potential runtime impact.

1. Comment Syntax Warnings (-Wcomment)
Count: ~100+ (appears in every file including tradstdc.h)
Example: ../include/tradstdc.h:434:34: warning: "/*" within comment [-Wcomment]
Cause: Nested comments (/* ... /* ... */) are invalid in C; only one level is allowed.
Fix: In tradstdc.h, rewrite lines 434-435 to avoid nesting:
c
Wrap
Copy
/* #define __warn_unused_result__ empty */
/* #define warn_unused_result empty */
Lesson: C doesn’t support nested comments. Use // (C99+) or separate single-line /* */ comments.
2. Implicit Function Declarations (-Wimplicit-function-declaration)
Count: 3
Examples:
allmain.c:462:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘curses_update_inventory’
botl.c:409:21: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’
pline.c:740:13: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’
Cause: Functions called without prior declaration or included header.
Fix:
For curses_update_inventory, ensure cursinvt.h is included in allmain.c if it’s defined there (check cursinvt.c).
For flushinp, include hack.h (defines it) in botl.c and pline.c.
Lesson: Always declare functions before use (in headers or locally). Missing declarations can lead to incorrect argument passing or linking errors.
3. Format Overflow Warnings (-Wformat-overflow)
Count: ~30
Examples:
botl.c:2967:24: warning: ‘/’ directive writing 1 byte into a region of size between 0 and 255
cmd.c:1867:28: warning: ‘%s’ directive writing up to 255 bytes into a region of size 253
Cause: Sprintf risks overflowing fixed-size buffers (often char buf[256]) with long strings.
Fix: Use snprintf (C99) with buffer size:
c
Wrap
Copy
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s/%s/%s", a, b, c);
Check all Sprintf calls in affected files (e.g., botl.c, cmd.c, do_name.c) and replace.
Lesson: Buffer overflows are a common C bug. Use size-aware functions like snprintf to prevent them.
4. Unused Variables/Parameters (-Wunused-variable, -Wunused-parameter)
Count: ~20
Examples:
botl.c:379:15: warning: unused variable ‘kk’
display.c:2035:5: warning: unused parameter ‘x0’
Cause: Variables or parameters declared but not used.
Fix:
Remove unused variables (e.g., kk, jj, ii in botl.c).
For parameters, use (void) to suppress:
c
Wrap
Copy
void set_twall(int x0, int y0) { (void)x0; (void)y0; ... }
Lesson: Unused code can confuse maintainers. Clean it up or mark it intentionally unused with (void).
5. Missing Field Initializers (-Wmissing-field-initializers)
Count: ~60
Examples:
cmd.c:3397:13: warning: missing initializer for field ‘f_text’
decl.c:42:8: warning: missing initializer for field ‘d_bigroom_level’
Cause: Structs initialized without all fields specified (C99 allows this, but -Wextra flags it).
Fix: Fully initialize or silence with explicit zeros:
c
Wrap
Copy
struct ext_func_tab cmd = { doextcmd, IFBURIED | GENERALCMD, NULL };
Lesson: Struct initialization in C requires care. Use designated initializers (e.g., .field = value) for clarity.
6. Array Bounds Warnings (-Warray-bounds)
Count: 4
Example: botl.c:382:9: warning: ‘__builtin_memcpy’ forming offset [16, 254] is out of the bounds [0, 16]
Cause: memcpy copies beyond source/destination bounds, risking undefined behavior.
Fix: Check memcpy calls in botl.c (lines 382, 401, 417, 432). Ensure source/destination sizes match:
c
Wrap
Copy
memcpy(dest, src, MIN(sizeof(dest), strlen(src) + 1));
Lesson: Bounds checking is critical in C. Use sizeof or explicit lengths to avoid overflows.
7. String Truncation Warnings (-Wstringop-truncation)
Count: 5
Example: cmd.c:2733:20: warning: ‘__builtin_strncpy’ output truncated before terminating nul
Cause: strncpy doesn’t guarantee null termination if source is longer than length.
Fix: Use snprintf or ensure null termination:
c
Wrap
Copy
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", " if not for ");
Lesson: strncpy is tricky—prefer snprintf for safer string handling.
8. Unused Result Warnings (-Wunused-result)
Count: ~10
Example: files.c:982:12: warning: ignoring return value of ‘write’
Cause: Functions with __attribute__((warn_unused_result)) (e.g., write, read) ignored.
Fix: Check return values or cast to (void) if intentional:
c
Wrap
Copy
if (write(fd, SAVEF, sizeof(SAVEF)) < 0) { /* handle error */ }
Lesson: System calls can fail—always check return values for robustness.
9. Other Miscellaneous Warnings
Sign Comparison (-Wsign-compare): pline.c:688:50—cast one operand (e.g., (unsigned int)j).
Parentheses (-Wparentheses): dothrow.c:177:57—add parentheses for clarity.
Empty Body (-Wempty-body): sp_lev.c:3208:17—remove or comment intent.
Format Truncation (-Wformat-truncation): pline.c:737:53—increase sayit buffer size (e.g., 1024).
Action Plan
Start Here: Fix implicit declarations (#2) and array bounds (#6)—these could crash your game.
Next: Tackle format overflows (#3) for security (buffer overflows are exploitable).
Then: Clean up unused variables (#4) and missing initializers (#5) for clarity.
Optional: Comment syntax (#1) and unused results (#8) if you want a warning-free build.
For Requirement 3
Pick a file (e.g., botl.c), apply fixes, and recompile (make clean && make all).
Ask me about specific fixes or C concepts as you go—I’ll explain each step.
Which category do you want to start with? Share updated output if you try fixes!






Thak you. I'll follow your lead and tackle #2 and #6 in that order. Question: Can I set my compile-time flags to address only one issue at a time?


You're welcome! Yes, you can tweak your compile-time flags to focus on one warning type at a time, which is a great strategy for isolating and addressing issues incrementally. Since you're using GCC (based on your output), you can enable or disable specific warnings with the -W flags. Your current CFLAGS include -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers, which enable a broad set of warnings. To target just one category, you can adjust these flags in your Makefile.

How to Modify Flags for One Warning at a Time
Locate CFLAGS in Your Makefile: From your earlier snippet, it’s defined like this:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB ...
CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers
Edit CFLAGS to Focus on One Warning:
Remove -Wall -Wextra (they enable many warnings) and add only the specific warning flag you want.
Keep other flags (e.g., -g -O) unchanged.
Flags for Your Targets:
#2: Implicit Function Declarations (-Wimplicit-function-declaration):
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB ... -Wimplicit-function-declaration
#6: Array Bounds (-Warray-bounds):
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB ... -Warray-bounds
Recompile: Run make clean && make all after each change to see only the targeted warnings.
Example Workflow
Step 1: Focus on #2
Edit Makefile to use -Wimplicit-function-declaration.
Run make clean && make all > output.txt.
Check output.txt for only implicit declaration warnings (e.g., curses_update_inventory, flushinp).
Fix those, then move to #6.
Step 2: Focus on #6
Edit Makefile to use -Warray-bounds.
Recompile and check output for array bounds issues (e.g., botl.c memcpy warnings).
Address those next.
Notes
Restoring All Warnings: After fixing #2 and #6, revert to your original CFLAGS to catch any remaining issues:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB ... -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers
Fine-Grained Control: You can suppress other warnings with -Wno-<warning> (e.g., -Wno-unused-variable) alongside your target flag, but starting with just one enabled is cleaner.
Answering Your Question Directly
Yes, you can set flags to address one issue at a time by specifying only the relevant -W flag in CFLAGS. Start with -Wimplicit-function-declaration for #2, fix those three instances, then switch to -Warray-bounds for #6.

Let me know if you need help editing the Makefile or interpreting the output after recompiling with these changes! Ready to start with #2?

Yes, you can configure GCC to stop compilation when it encounters a warning by treating warnings as errors. This is done with the -Werror flag, which you can combine with a specific warning flag (e.g., -Wimplicit-function-declaration) to halt on just that type of warning. This aligns perfectly with your plan to tackle #2 (implicit function declarations) and #6 (array bounds) one at a time.

Modifying Your Makefile to Stop on Warnings
Here’s how to update your Makefile to stop compilation on a specific warning:

Current CFLAGS:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB ...
CFLAGS += -Wimplicit-function-declaration
Add -Werror for Specific Warnings:
To stop on implicit function declaration warnings (#2):
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB -DCOMPRESS=\"/bin/gzip\" -DCOMPRESS_EXTENSION=\".gz\" -DSYSCF -DSYSCF_FILE=\"$(HACKDIR)/sysconf\" -DSECURE -DTIMED_DELAY -DHACKDIR=\"$(HACKDIR)\" -DDUMPLOG -DDEBUG -DCONFIG_ERROR_SECURE=FALSE -DCURSES_GRAPHICS -DSCORE_ON_BOTL -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration
-Werror=implicit-function-declaration makes only this warning fatal, stopping compilation.
To stop on array bounds warnings (#6):
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB -DCOMPRESS=\"/bin/gzip\" -DCOMPRESS_EXTENSION=\".gz\" -DSYSCF -DSYSCF_FILE=\"$(HACKDIR)/sysconf\" -DSECURE -DTIMED_DELAY -DHACKDIR=\"$(HACKDIR)\" -DDUMPLOG -DDEBUG -DCONFIG_ERROR_SECURE=FALSE -DCURSES_GRAPHICS -DSCORE_ON_BOTL -Warray-bounds -Werror=array-bounds
Recompile:
Run make clean && make all.
Compilation will stop at the first occurrence of the specified warning, showing the file and line number.
Example Output
For -Werror=implicit-function-declaration, you might see:

text
Wrap
Copy
allmain.c:462:5: error: implicit declaration of function ‘curses_update_inventory’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  462 |     curses_update_inventory();
      |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cc1: some warnings being treated as errors
make[1]: *** [Makefile:rule] Error 1
Compilation stops here, letting you fix allmain.c before proceeding.

Workflow
Start with #2:
Add -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration to CFLAGS.
Run make clean && make all.
Fix the first error (e.g., add #include "cursinvt.h" to allmain.c for curses_update_inventory), then repeat until no more errors.
Move to #6:
Replace with -Warray-bounds -Werror=array-bounds.
Recompile and fix each memcpy issue in botl.c (e.g., ensure bounds match).
Verify Fixes:
Once both are fixed, restore your original CFLAGS with -Wall -Wextra to check for other issues.
Notes
General -Werror: If you use just -Werror without specifying a warning, all warnings become errors, which might overwhelm you with ~200 stops. Stick to -Werror=<specific-warning> for now.
Makefile Edit: Replace the entire CFLAGS block in one go to avoid duplicate += lines causing issues.
Want to try this with #2 first? Let me know if you need help with the exact fix for curses_update_inventory or flushinp once it stops!






I'm really confused: My Makefile does not have: -Wall -Wextra, but the cc does:

cc -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB -DCOMPRESS=\"/bin/gzip\" -DCOMPRESS_EXTENSION=\".gz\" -DSYSCF -DSYSCF_FILE=\"/home/jtratt/vnh366/install/games/lib/nethackdir/sysconf\" -DSECURE -DTIMED_DELAY -DHACKDIR=\"/home/jtratt/vnh366/install/games/lib/nethackdir\" -DDUMPLOG -DDEBUG -DCONFIG_ERROR_SECURE=FALSE -DCURSES_GRAPHICS -DSCORE_ON_BOTL -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers -c objects.c
make[2]: Entering directory '/home/jtratt/source/voice_Nethack_366/util'


I see the confusion! Your Makefile defines CFLAGS without -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers, yet the cc command in your build output includes them. This happens because another part of your build system—likely a subdirectory Makefile (e.g., src/Makefile)—is overriding or appending to CFLAGS during compilation. Let’s sort this out and get you set up to stop on specific warnings.

Why -Wall -Wextra Appear
Top-Level Makefile: Your posted Makefile sets CFLAGS initially:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS = -g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB ...
CFLAGS += -Wimplicit-function-declaration
Subdirectory Override: When you run make all, it invokes make in src/ (and other dirs), where src/Makefile likely adds -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers. This is common in multi-directory projects like NetHack, where the top-level Makefile sets base flags, and sub-Makefiles refine them for specific targets.
Evidence: Your cc command includes those extra flags, and the output shows make[1]: Entering directory '/home/jtratt/source/voice_Nethack_366/src', confirming src/Makefile is involved.
Fixing the Confusion
To control warnings and stop on specific ones, you need to modify the CFLAGS in the Makefile that’s actually driving the cc commands—likely src/Makefile. Here’s how:

Locate src/Makefile:
Check /home/jtratt/source/voice_Nethack_366/src/Makefile.
Look for a CFLAGS definition or an override (e.g., CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra ...).
Edit src/Makefile:
If src/Makefile appends to CFLAGS, you’ll see something like:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers
Temporarily replace it with your specific warning and error flag. For #2 (implicit function declarations):
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS += -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration
If src/Makefile Isn’t the Culprit:
The top-level Makefile invokes src/Makefile with a command like ( cd src ; $(MAKE) ). It might pass CFLAGS explicitly:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
( cd src ; $(MAKE) CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS) -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers" )
If so, modify your top-level Makefile’s $(GAME) or all target to pass only the desired flags:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
$(GAME):
        ( cd src ; $(MAKE) CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS) -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration" )
Quick Test
Since editing src/Makefile is the most likely fix, let’s assume it’s there:

Open src/Makefile.
Find the CFLAGS line.
Change it to:
makefile
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS += -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration
Run:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
It should stop at the first implicit declaration error (e.g., allmain.c:462:5: error: implicit declaration of function ‘curses_update_inventory’).
Verifying the Fix
If it stops as expected (e.g., at curses_update_inventory), great! You’ve isolated #2.
If -Wall -Wextra still appear, the override is elsewhere. Check the make output for the exact cc command and trace back the rule in src/Makefile or the top-level Makefile.
Next Steps
For #2: Once it stops, I’ll help you fix the three instances (curses_update_inventory, flushinp in botl.c and pline.c).
For #6: Switch to -Warray-bounds -Werror=array-bounds after #2 is done.
Can you check src/Makefile and share its CFLAGS line (or the relevant part)? If it’s not there, I’ll guide you to adjust the top-level Makefile instead. Let’s get this sorted!






vim sys/unix/hints/linux
cd sys/unix/ && sh setup.sh  hints/linux && cd ../..
fixes both Makefiles


You’re absolutely right—running sys/unix/setup.sh hints/linux updates both the top-level Makefile and src/Makefile based on the hints/linux configuration file. This is a common setup step in NetHack to tailor the build for your system, and it explains why your manually edited CFLAGS didn’t fully control the cc command. The hints/linux file defines the default flags (including -Wall -Wextra), which setup.sh then propagates to the generated Makefiles. Let’s use this to set up your build to stop on specific warnings.

Understanding the Setup
sys/unix/hints/linux: This file contains build settings (e.g., CFLAGS, WINTTYLIB) for Linux.
setup.sh: It reads hints/linux and generates Makefile and src/Makefile with those settings.
Current Behavior: Your cc command includes -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers because hints/linux likely specifies them.
Modifying hints/linux to Stop on Warnings
To make compilation stop on specific warnings (e.g., #2: -Wimplicit-function-declaration), edit sys/unix/hints/linux and re-run setup.sh.

Open sys/unix/hints/linux:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim sys/unix/hints/linux
Find the CFLAGS Line:
Look for a line like:
bash
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS="-O -I../include -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers"
It might vary slightly, but it’s where the warning flags are set.
Edit for #2 (Implicit Function Declarations):
Replace it with:
bash
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS="-g -O -I../include -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration"
Keep -g -O -I../include for debugging and optimization, but focus only on -Wimplicit-function-declaration with -Werror to stop on those warnings.
Regenerate Makefiles:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cd sys/unix/ && sh setup.sh hints/linux && cd ../..
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
This should stop at the first implicit declaration warning (e.g., allmain.c:462).
Moving to #6 (Array Bounds)
Once #2 is fixed:

Edit hints/linux again:
bash
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS="-g -O -I../include -Warray-bounds -Werror=array-bounds"
Rerun:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cd sys/unix/ && sh setup.sh hints/linux && cd ../..
make clean && make all
It’ll stop at the first array bounds warning (e.g., botl.c:382).
Restoring Full Warnings
After fixing #2 and #6, restore the original CFLAGS in hints/linux (e.g., with -Wall -Wextra) and rerun setup.sh to catch any remaining issues.

Confirming the Change
Check the generated src/Makefile after running setup.sh:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cat src/Makefile | grep CFLAGS
It should reflect your new CFLAGS from hints/linux.
Current hints/linux Content
Since I don’t have your exact hints/linux, here’s a typical snippet you might see:

bash
Wrap
Copy
# Default
CFLAGS="-O -I../include -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers"
WINTTYLIB="-lncurses -ltinfo"
You’d change CFLAGS as above.

Next Step
Edit hints/linux, set CFLAGS for #2, and run the setup. If it stops as expected, share the error output (e.g., allmain.c:462), and I’ll guide you through the fix. If it doesn’t work, share your hints/linux or the new cc command from the build output. Ready to try this?






Ok, now we've got something to fix:

make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/jtratt/source/voice_Nethack_366/src'
make: *** [Makefile:165: nethack] Error 2


Great, we've successfully isolated the first implicit function declaration warning in allmain.c, and compilation stopped as intended! Let’s fix this and move forward.

The Issue
Error: allmain.c:462:5: error: implicit declaration of function ‘curses_update_inventory’
Line: curses_update_inventory();
Cause: The function curses_update_inventory() is called without a prior declaration. GCC suggests update_inventory() as a possible match, but that’s likely incorrect since you’re using -DCURSES_GRAPHICS, indicating a curses-based interface.
Investigating the Fix
Where It’s Defined: Since this is part of the curses window system (CURSES_GRAPHICS), curses_update_inventory() is likely defined in the curses window code, specifically in win/curses/.
Header Check: The declaration should be in a header file included by allmain.c. The relevant header is probably win/curses/cursinvt.h, which handles curses inventory functions.
Steps to Fix
Verify the Function:
Check win/curses/cursinvt.c for the definition of curses_update_inventory(). Run:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -r "curses_update_inventory" win/curses/
You should see it defined in cursinvt.c, likely as:
c
Wrap
Copy
void curses_update_inventory(void) { ... }
Add the Header:
Open allmain.c:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim src/allmain.c
Look for existing includes near the top (e.g., #include "hack.h").
Add the curses inventory header if it’s not there:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include "cursinvt.h"
Place it below #include "hack.h" or with other window-related includes.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
If cursinvt.h declares curses_update_inventory(), this should resolve the error and move to the next implicit declaration (likely flushinp).
Why This Works
cursinvt.h: This header should contain the prototype:
c
Wrap
Copy
void curses_update_inventory(void);
C Lesson: In C, every function must be declared before use, either in the source file or via a header. Missing declarations lead to implicit assumptions (e.g., returning int), which can cause runtime errors.
If It Doesn’t Work
Header Missing Declaration: If cursinvt.h doesn’t have the prototype:
Add it manually to win/curses/cursinvt.h:
c
Wrap
Copy
extern void curses_update_inventory(void);
Or declare it locally in allmain.c before moveloop:
c
Wrap
Copy
void curses_update_inventory(void);
Wrong Function: If curses_update_inventory() isn’t in cursinvt.c, it might be a typo or undefined. Check your voice_Nethack_366 fork for custom changes.
Expected Next Stop
After fixing this, compilation should stop at the next implicit declaration:

botl.c:409:21: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’ We’ll tackle that next (it’s likely declared in hack.h, which botl.c already includes, so it might need a different fix).
Action
Add #include "cursinvt.h" to allmain.c, recompile, and let me know the result! If you hit a snag (e.g., header not found), share the output or grep results. Ready to test this fix?






include/wincurs.h:extern void curses_update_inventory(void);
src/allmain.c:    curses_update_inventory(); // enables cursed items to be identified immediately
win/curses/cursinvt.c:               call (*update_inventory) [curses_update_inventory] which
win/curses/cursmain.c:    curses_update_inventory,
win/curses/cursmain.c:curses_update_inventory(void)
win/curses/cursinit.c:                curses_update_inventory();


Thanks for the details! Your grep results confirm that curses_update_inventory() is indeed part of the curses window system, and its declaration is in include/wincurs.h (not cursinvt.h as I initially guessed—my apologies for the mix-up). Let’s fix the implicit declaration error in allmain.c.

Analysis of Your Findings
include/wincurs.h: Declares extern void curses_update_inventory(void);—this is the correct header.
src/allmain.c: Calls curses_update_inventory() without including wincurs.h.
win/curses/cursinvt.c: Mentions it in a comment, but doesn’t define it.
win/curses/cursmain.c: Defines curses_update_inventory(void) and references it in a function pointer array.
win/curses/cursinit.c: Also calls it, implying it includes wincurs.h.
The Fix
Since wincurs.h provides the declaration, add it to allmain.c:

Edit allmain.c:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim src/allmain.c
Add the Include: Near the top, with other includes (e.g., after #include "hack.h"), add:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include "wincurs.h"
Your allmain.c might already have #include "hack.h" and others. Ensure no duplicate includes.
Save and Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
This should resolve the error at allmain.c:462.
Why This Works
wincurs.h: As the curses window system header, it declares curses-specific functions like curses_update_inventory().
C Lesson: Including the right header ensures the compiler knows the function’s signature (return type, parameters), preventing implicit declaration errors. Without it, C assumes an int return type, which mismatches void and can break linking or runtime behavior.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should proceed past allmain.c:462.
It’ll likely stop next at botl.c:409 for flushinp:
text
Wrap
Copy
botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
We’ll fix that after confirming this works.
If It Fails
Header Not Found: If wincurs.h isn’t in include/, verify your directory structure. It should be there since it’s referenced elsewhere.
Still Stops: Share the new error output if it doesn’t move to flushinp.
Action
Add #include "wincurs.h" to allmain.c, recompile, and let me know what happens! We’re on track to knock out #2 (implicit declarations) one by one. Ready?

Good progress—adding #include "wincurs.h" fixed the implicit declaration of curses_update_inventory(), but now we’ve hit a new issue: wincurs.h relies on types (WINDOW and attr_t) that aren’t defined because the curses library header (e.g., <curses.h> or <ncurses.h>) isn’t included. Let’s resolve this.

The Issue
Errors:
../include/wincurs.h:12:8: error: unknown type name ‘WINDOW’
../include/wincurs.h:197:46: error: unknown type name ‘attr_t’
Cause: wincurs.h declares functions and variables using WINDOW and attr_t, which are defined in the curses library (typically ncurses.h on Linux, given your WINTTYLIB=-lncurses -ltinfo). However, wincurs.h doesn’t include <ncurses.h> itself, and allmain.c isn’t pulling it in either.
Why This Happens
NetHack Design: wincurs.h assumes the including file (e.g., allmain.c) or another header has already included the curses library. Your original build worked because other headers (e.g., hack.h) might indirectly include it, but with our minimal CFLAGS, we’ve exposed the dependency.
Minimal Flags: By stripping CFLAGS to -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration, we removed broader includes or flags that pulled in <ncurses.h>.
The Fix
Add #include <ncurses.h> to wincurs.h to ensure WINDOW and attr_t are defined:

Edit wincurs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/wincurs.h
Add the Include: At the top of wincurs.h, before any declarations, add:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <ncurses.h>
Place it before the first use of WINDOW (line 12).
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
This should resolve the type errors and let compilation proceed.
Why This Works
<ncurses.h>: Defines WINDOW (a pointer to a curses window structure) and attr_t (an attribute type for text styling). Since your build links with -lncurses -ltinfo, <ncurses.h> is the correct header for your system.
C Lesson: Header files must include all dependencies for types they use, or the including source file must. Here, wincurs.h should self-contain its curses dependencies to avoid this fragility.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should move past allmain.c and likely stop at the next implicit declaration:
botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’
We’ll fix that next (it’s declared in hack.h, so we’ll investigate why it’s not visible).
If It Fails
<ncurses.h> Not Found: If the compiler can’t find it, ensure ncurses-dev is installed:
bash
Wrap
Copy
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev  # or libncurses-dev depending on your distro
Still Errors: If WINDOW or attr_t remain undefined, try #include <curses.h> instead (some systems symlink it to ncurses.h). Share the output if this happens.
Action
Add #include <ncurses.h> to wincurs.h, recompile, and let me know the result! We’re close to clearing all implicit declaration errors for #2. Ready to test?

win/tty/termcap.c:#include <curses.h>


Thanks for the grep output—it clarifies that your NetHack codebase predominantly uses <curses.h> rather than <ncurses.h>, though wincurs.h currently has #include <ncurses.h> (likely from your last edit). The errors in wincurs.h (unknown type name ‘WINDOW’ and ‘attr_t’) suggest that <ncurses.h> isn’t being found or isn’t defining them as expected, while <curses.h> is the standard include in other files. Let’s adjust to use <curses.h> instead, since it’s consistent with your build and likely links to ncurses on your system (common on Linux where /usr/include/curses.h is a symlink to ncurses.h).

Analysis
grep Results:
<curses.h> appears in win/curses/*.c, sys/share/unixtty.c, and win/tty/termcap.c.
wincurs.h has #include <ncurses.h> (your addition), but no other <ncurses.h> usage exists.
Comments (e.g., doc/fixes36.1, sys/share/unixtty.c) mention <curses.h> compatibility issues, reinforcing its use.
Build Flags: Your cc command links with -lncurses -ltinfo, and on Linux, <curses.h> typically pulls in ncurses functionality.
Conclusion: <curses.h> is the intended include; <ncurses.h> was a misstep.
The Fix
Replace #include <ncurses.h> with #include <curses.h> in wincurs.h:

Edit wincurs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/wincurs.h
Update the Include: Change:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <ncurses.h>
to:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <curses.h>
Place it at the top, before WINDOW declarations (line 12).
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
This should define WINDOW and attr_t, resolving the errors.
Why This Works
<curses.h>: On your system, this is likely a symlink to <ncurses.h> or a wrapper that includes it, defining WINDOW (a struct pointer) and attr_t (an attribute type). Your link flags (-lncurses) ensure ncurses is used.
Consistency: Matches the rest of your codebase (e.g., win/curses/cursmain.c), which compiles fine with <curses.h>.
C Lesson: Header includes must align with the library linked (-lncurses here). Using the wrong header (e.g., <ncurses.h> directly) can fail if the build environment expects <curses.h>.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should proceed past allmain.c and stop at the next implicit declaration:
Likely botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’.
We’ll fix that next.
If It Fails
<curses.h> Not Found: Unlikely, but if it happens, install ncurses-dev:
bash
Wrap
Copy
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
Still Errors: If WINDOW or attr_t remain undefined, check /usr/include/curses.h exists and includes ncurses. Share the output or:
bash
Wrap
Copy
ls -l /usr/include/curses.h
Different Stop: Share the new error if it’s not flushinp.
Action
Replace #include <ncurses.h> with #include <curses.h> in wincurs.h, recompile, and let me know what happens! We’re closing in on fixing all #2 issues. Ready to test?






ls -l $(whereis ncurses.h)
ls: cannot access 'ncurses.h:': No such file or directory
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 99K Apr  8  2024 /usr/include/ncurses.h

neonXPSj $ ls -l $(whereis curses.h)
ls: cannot access 'curses.h:': No such file or directory
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 99K Apr  8  2024 /usr/include/curses.h


Your ls -l output confirms that both ncurses.h and curses.h exist on your system, but there’s a slight misunderstanding in how whereis works with ls. The command ls -l $(whereis ncurses.h) didn’t work as expected because whereis returns a formatted string (e.g., ncurses.h: /usr/include/ncurses.h), and ls interprets the colon and space incorrectly. However, your manual listing shows:

/usr/include/ncurses.h: Exists, 99K, dated April 8, 2024.
/usr/include/curses.h: Exists, 99K, dated April 8, 2024.
This suggests curses.h is likely a symlink to or wrapper for ncurses.h (common on Linux), and either should work since you’re linking with -lncurses. Let’s clarify and proceed with the fix.

Clarifying the Headers
Check Symlink:
bash
Wrap
Copy
ls -l /usr/include/curses.h
If it’s a symlink (e.g., lrwxrwxrwx ... /usr/include/curses.h -> ncurses.h), <curses.h> includes ncurses.h implicitly.
File Size: Both are 99K, hinting they’re identical or one includes the other.
Given your build uses -lncurses and the codebase favors <curses.h> (per your grep), we’ll stick with <curses.h> in wincurs.h.

Previous Fix Confirmation
You mentioned <curses.h> is in many files, so let’s ensure wincurs.h uses it:

Edit wincurs.h (if not already done):
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/wincurs.h
Replace:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <ncurses.h>
with:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <curses.h>
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Your last output showed errors with <ncurses.h>. If you’ve already switched to <curses.h> and recompiled, share the new output. If not, this should resolve the WINDOW and attr_t errors.
Expected Behavior
With <curses.h>:
WINDOW and attr_t should be defined (they’re in /usr/include/curses.h or via ncurses.h).
Compilation should move past allmain.c to the next implicit declaration (e.g., flushinp in botl.c).
Troubleshooting
If WINDOW Errors Persist:
Verify <curses.h> is valid:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep WINDOW /usr/include/curses.h
Look for typedef ... WINDOW; or #include <ncurses.h>.
Try <ncurses.h> again in wincurs.h:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <ncurses.h>
Recompile and compare.
Output Needed: If you’ve already tried <curses.h> and got a new error, share it. If not, test the above.
Your System Insight
/usr/include/curses.h and /usr/include/ncurses.h both exist, and your -lncurses suggests ncurses is the backend. <curses.h> is the safer bet for NetHack consistency.
Action
If you haven’t switched wincurs.h to #include <curses.h> yet, do it and recompile. If you have, share the latest make output (e.g., did it stop at flushinp?). We’re almost through #2! Ready to proceed?






THey appear to be separate files, but diff as the same.
diff /usr/include/ncurses.h /usr/include/curses.h


1000 /bin/bash:tty1 /home/jtratt/s/voice_Nethack_366 
neonXPSj $ 


Your observation that /usr/include/ncurses.h and /usr/include/curses.h are separate files but diff shows no differences is interesting. It means they’re identical in content on your system (both 99K, dated April 8, 2024), likely because your distribution (e.g., Ubuntu or Debian) installs curses.h as a copy of or wrapper for ncurses.h. This explains why either should work, but <curses.h> aligns with NetHack’s conventions. Let’s move forward with the fix and see what happens.

Recap
Last Error: Adding #include "wincurs.h" to allmain.c fixed the curses_update_inventory() implicit declaration, but wincurs.h failed due to missing WINDOW and attr_t definitions with #include <ncurses.h>.
Current Step: You’ve confirmed <curses.h> is viable. We need to update wincurs.h to use it and recompile.
The Fix
Edit wincurs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cd /home/jtratt/source/voice_Nethack_366
vim include/wincurs.h
Replace:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <ncurses.h>
with:
c
Wrap
Copy
#include <curses.h>
Ensure it’s at the top, before WINDOW declarations (line 12).
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
This should resolve the WINDOW and attr_t errors in wincurs.h, letting allmain.c compile.
Why This Should Work
<curses.h> Content: Since it’s identical to ncurses.h on your system, it defines WINDOW and attr_t (likely via typedef struct _win_st WINDOW; and typedef chtype attr_t;).
NetHack Consistency: Most win/curses/*.c files use <curses.h>, and your build links -lncurses, so this matches the expected setup.
C Lesson: Identical headers can exist for compatibility (e.g., POSIX curses.h vs. ncurses extensions), but you should use the one your project standardizes on.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should succeed for allmain.c.
It’ll likely stop at the next implicit declaration:
botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’
We’ll fix that next (it’s in hack.h, so we’ll check why it’s missing).
If It Fails
Same Errors: If WINDOW or attr_t still aren’t defined:
Verify <curses.h> includes them:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -E "WINDOW|attr_t" /usr/include/curses.h
Expect lines like typedef ... WINDOW; or #include <ncurses.h>.
If empty, your curses.h might be broken. Reinstall ncurses-dev:
bash
Wrap
Copy
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libncurses5-dev
New Error: Share the output if it stops elsewhere.
Action
Update wincurs.h to #include <curses.h>, recompile, and let me know the result! We’re making steady progress on #2. Ready to test this?






Yes, curses.h fixed it. Next error:

Excellent—switching to #include <curses.h> in wincurs.h fixed the WINDOW and attr_t issues! Now we’ve hit a new error in allmain.c due to a macro definition in winprocs.h. This isn’t an implicit function declaration (our #2 focus), but it’s stopping compilation, so let’s address it before moving to the next #2 issue (flushinp).

The Issue
Error: ../include/winprocs.h:135:35: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘.’ token
Line: #define delay_output (*windowprocs.win_delay_output)
Cause: The macro delay_output tries to dereference windowprocs (a struct pointer) and access its win_delay_output member, but the syntax is invalid or windowprocs isn’t properly defined/declared at this point.
Analysis
winprocs.h: This header defines the window procedure structure (struct window_procs) and a global pointer windowprocs for runtime window system selection (e.g., tty, curses). The macro redefines delay_output() to call the function pointer in windowprocs.
Context: Included via hack.h:240 into allmain.c. The error suggests:
windowprocs isn’t declared before line 135 in winprocs.h.
A syntax error in the macro or prior declaration.
Investigating winprocs.h
Expected Declaration: Before the macro, winprocs.h should declare:
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
struct window_procs typically includes a function pointer like:
c
Wrap
Copy
struct window_procs {
    void (*win_delay_output)(void);
    /* other members */
};
Macro Intent: #define delay_output (*windowprocs.win_delay_output) should expand to call the win_delay_output function via the pointer.
The Fix
The error expected ‘)’ before ‘.’ token implies the compiler doesn’t recognize windowprocs as a pointer or struct. Likely, windowprocs isn’t declared yet in winprocs.h at line 135. Let’s ensure it’s defined:

Edit winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Check and Add Declaration:
Look around line 135. If extern struct window_procs windowprocs; isn’t above the macro, add it near the top (e.g., after includes, before macros):
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
If it’s already there, the issue might be a missing struct window_procs definition.
Verify struct window_procs:
Ensure struct window_procs is defined before the macro. It’s typically in winprocs.h or decl.h (included by hack.h). Look for:
c
Wrap
Copy
struct window_procs {
    void (*win_delay_output)(void);
    /* other function pointers */
};
If missing in winprocs.h, it might be in decl.h. Check:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep "struct window_procs" include/decl.h
Correct Syntax (if needed):
The macro should be:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Parentheses ensure proper dereferencing and calling. Your version lacks (), which might confuse the parser, though the error suggests a deeper issue.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why This Happens
Order: If windowprocs isn’t declared before the macro, the compiler sees windowprocs as undefined, causing a syntax error.
Macro Syntax: Without (), it’s a dereference without a call, but the error points to declaration order.
C Lesson: Macros and struct pointers require careful declaration order. Headers must be self-contained or rely on prior includes (e.g., decl.h).
Expected Outcome
With extern struct window_procs windowprocs; added above the macro, compilation should proceed.
Next stop should be botl.c:409 for flushinp.
If It Fails
Still Errors: Share lines 130-140 of winprocs.h to see the context.
struct window_procs Missing: If not in winprocs.h or decl.h, we’ll add it explicitly.
Action
Add extern struct window_procs windowprocs; above line 135 in winprocs.h, recompile, and let me know the result! We’ll get past this and back to #2. Ready?

Thanks Thanks for sharing the snippet of winprocs.h and the updated error output! It seems I misunderstood the structure of your winprocs.h—line 10 already declares extern struct window_procs windowprocs;, so the issue isn’t a missing declaration. The new errors indicate a conflict and a macro syntax problem. Let’s break this down and fix it.

The Issues
Conflicting Type Qualifiers:
Error: ../include/winprocs.h:91:34: error: conflicting type qualifiers for ‘windowprocs’
Line 10: extern struct window_procs windowprocs; (declaration)
Line 91: NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; (definition with NEARDATA)
Cause: NEARDATA (likely a macro for near or nothing, depending on platform) conflicts with the extern declaration. You can’t have extern in one place and a definition with a different qualifier elsewhere in the same translation unit.
Macro Syntax Error:
Error: ../include/winprocs.h:137:35: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘.’ token
Line 137: #define delay_output (*windowprocs.win_delay_output)
Cause: The macro syntax is incorrect for a function call. It dereferences windowprocs but doesn’t invoke the function pointer properly (missing ()).
Analysis
windowprocs Declaration:
Line 10 declares it as extern, which is correct for a header—it promises the variable is defined elsewhere (e.g., in a .c file like decl.c).
Line 91 redefines it with NEARDATA, which is likely the actual definition, but it shouldn’t be in the header unless guarded properly.
Macro:
#define delay_output (*windowprocs.win_delay_output) tries to alias delay_output to the function pointer in windowprocs, but without (), it’s not a callable macro.
The Fix
We need to:

Resolve the conflicting declaration/definition of windowprocs.
Fix the macro syntax.
Step 1: Fix windowprocs Conflict
Problem: winprocs.h shouldn’t define windowprocs (line 91); it should only declare it (line 10). The definition belongs in a .c file (e.g., decl.c).
Check decl.c:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep "windowprocs" src/decl.c
Expect something like:
c
Wrap
Copy
struct window_procs windowprocs;
If it’s there, winprocs.h shouldn’t redefine it.
Edit winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Remove or Comment Line 91:
c
Wrap
Copy
/* NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; */  /* Remove or comment this */
Keep line 10:
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
This ensures winprocs.h only declares windowprocs, and the definition stays in decl.c.
Step 2: Fix the Macro
Current: #define delay_output (*windowprocs.win_delay_output)
Fix: Add parentheses to make it a callable function:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Explanation:
windowprocs is a pointer to struct window_procs.
win_delay_output is a function pointer (e.g., void (*win_delay_output)(void)).
(*windowprocs.win_delay_output) dereferences to the function.
() calls it.
delay_output() makes it a macro that looks like a function call.
Edit winprocs.h: Replace line 137 with:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Recompile
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why This Works
Conflict: Removing the definition from winprocs.h avoids the NEARDATA vs. extern clash. The linker will find windowprocs in decl.c (or wherever it’s defined).
Macro: Correct syntax ensures delay_output() expands to a proper function call.
C Lesson: Headers should declare (not define) global variables with extern. Macros replacing function calls need proper syntax to match usage.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should pass allmain.c and move to the next implicit declaration (e.g., flushinp in botl.c).
If decl.c lacks the definition, you’ll get a linker error later—let me know if that happens.
If It Fails
Still Conflicts: Share the full winprocs.h or check decl.c for windowprocs.
Linker Error: If undefined reference to windowprocs, we’ll add the definition to decl.c.
New Error: Share the output.
Action
Comment out or remove line 91 in winprocs.h.
Update line 137 to #define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)()).
Recompile and report back! We’re getting close to clearing #2. Ready?





I added line 10 per your instructions. Here is the only def I found apart from line 91
src/windows.c:    NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs;
if that is it?


Thanks for the update! I see the confusion—my earlier instruction assumed windowprocs was only declared in winprocs.h, but your winprocs.h snippet shows it’s both declared (extern at line 10) and defined (NEARDATA at line 91), which causes the conflict. Your grep found the actual definition in src/windows.c (NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs;), which is correct—global variables should be defined in a .c file, not a header. Let’s fix winprocs.h to remove the redundant definition and correct the macro.

Analysis
winprocs.h:
Line 10: extern struct window_procs windowprocs; (correct declaration).
Line 91: NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; (incorrect definition in header).
Line 137: #define delay_output (*windowprocs.win_delay_output) (bad syntax).
windows.c: NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; (correct definition).
Conflict: Line 91 in winprocs.h redefines windowprocs, clashing with windows.c and the extern at line 10.
Macro: Needs () for a proper function call.
The Fix
Edit winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Keep Line 10: It’s correct:
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
Remove Line 91: Delete or comment it out:
c
Wrap
Copy
/* NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; */  /* Remove this */
Reason: The definition belongs in windows.c, not here. Headers should only declare with extern.
Fix Line 137: Update the macro:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Verify windows.c:
Your grep confirms:
c
Wrap
Copy
NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs;
This is fine (NEARDATA is likely #defined as nothing or a memory attribute in config.h). No change needed here.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why This Works
Conflict Resolved: Removing line 91 from winprocs.h eliminates the duplicate definition. extern at line 10 tells the compiler windowprocs is defined elsewhere (in windows.c).
Macro Fixed: #define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)()) correctly expands to call the win_delay_output function pointer.
C Lesson: A global variable should be declared extern in a header (for all files to see) and defined exactly once in a .c file. Redefining it in the header causes linker or qualifier conflicts.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should pass allmain.c.
Next stop will likely be:
botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’
We’ll tackle that next (it’s declared in hack.h, so we’ll check why it’s not visible).
If It Fails
Linker Error: If undefined reference to windowprocs, ensure windows.c is compiled (it should be in src/Makefile’s object list).
Still Conflicts: Double-check line 91 is gone from winprocs.h. Share the new output.
New Error: Share it if it’s not flushinp.
Action
Confirm line 10 is extern struct window_procs windowprocs;.
Remove or comment out line 91 in winprocs.h.
Update line 137 to #define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)()).
Recompile and let me know! We’re almost back to #2 fixes. Ready to test?





Should I put line 10 on line 91?


No, you shouldn’t move line 10 (extern struct window_procs windowprocs;) to line 91 or replace line 91 with it. The extern declaration at line 10 is already in the right place—near the top of winprocs.h where it’s visible to all including files. Line 91’s NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; is a definition, not just a declaration, and it doesn’t belong in the header at all since windows.c defines windowprocs. Let’s clarify what to do.

What to Do
Line 10: Keep it where it is (around line 10):
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
This declares windowprocs for all files including winprocs.h.
Line 91: Remove or comment it out entirely:
c
Wrap
Copy
/* NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; */  /* Delete or comment this */
Reason: The definition is in src/windows.c (NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs;), and redefining it in winprocs.h causes the conflict.
Line 137: Fix the macro syntax:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Why Not Move Line 10 to 91?
Position: Line 10 is early in the header, making windowprocs visible to all subsequent declarations (e.g., the macro at 137). Moving it to line 91 would place it after some uses (like struct definitions or other macros), potentially causing errors if those depend on it.
Semantics: Line 10 is an extern declaration (no storage allocated), while line 91 is a definition (allocates storage). Replacing 91 with 10 doesn’t fix the issue—it just moves the declaration, leaving the macro syntax problem and risking order issues.
Corrected Steps
Edit winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Line 10: Ensure it’s:
c

Expected Outcome
The conflict (conflicting type qualifiers) should disappear since winprocs.h no longer defines windowprocs.
The macro error (expected ‘)’ before ‘.’) should resolve with the corrected syntax.
Compilation should move to the next implicit declaration (e.g., flushinp in botl.c).
If You Already Moved It
If you’ve moved line 10 to 91:

Move it back to line 10 (or near the top, after #include "botl.h").
Remove the old line 91 entirely.
Fix the macro as above, then recompile.
C Lesson
Declaration vs. Definition: extern declares a variable (tells the compiler it exists elsewhere); without extern, it defines it (allocates space). Headers should only declare globals with extern, not define them.
Action
Keep line 10 where it is, remove line 91, fix line 137, and recompile. Let me know the result! Ready?






I'm only asking this for my leaning purposes. include/winprocs.h looks like it has a lot of definitions (attachment:1)
winprocs.h


Thanks for sharing the full winprocs.h and your question—it’s a great one for learning! You’re right to notice that winprocs.h contains many definitions, and it’s worth exploring why most of them are okay while the windowprocs definition at line 91 caused trouble. Let’s break this down for your learning purposes and confirm the fix.

Why winprocs.h Has Definitions
winprocs.h contains three main types of "definitions":

Struct Definitions:
struct window_procs (lines 13-90): Defines the structure of window procedure function pointers (e.g., win_init_nhwindows, win_delay_output).
struct chain_procs (under #ifdef WINCHAIN): A variant for chained window systems.
Why Okay: These are type definitions, not variable definitions. They tell the compiler what struct window_procs looks like (its members) but don’t allocate storage. Multiple files can include this without conflict.
Macro Definitions:
Lines 132-210 (e.g., #define init_nhwindows (*windowprocs.win_init_nhwindows)): These redefine function names to call through windowprocs.
Why Okay: Macros are text substitutions handled by the preprocessor, not variable definitions. They don’t allocate storage or cause conflicts—they just rewrite code before compilation.
Exception: #define delay_output had a syntax error (missing ()), which we fixed.
Variable Declarations/Definitions:
Line 10: extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
Why Okay: extern declares windowprocs without defining it (no storage allocated). It’s a promise that the variable exists elsewhere (in windows.c).
Line 91 (original): NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs;
Why Problematic: This is a definition (allocates storage), not just a declaration. Headers shouldn’t define variables because every .c file including winprocs.h would get its own copy, leading to multiple definitions (linker error) or qualifier conflicts (like NEARDATA vs. extern).
The Key Learning Point
Declarations vs. Definitions:
Declaration: Tells the compiler about a name and type (e.g., extern int x;, struct window_procs;).
Definition: Allocates storage or provides the body (e.g., int x = 5;, struct window_procs windowprocs;).
Headers: Should only declare variables (extern) and define types/macros. Definitions belong in .c files to avoid duplicates.
Your Case: Line 91 was a definition in a header, conflicting with the extern at line 10 and the real definition in windows.c.
Current State (Based on Your Last Output)
Line 91 Removed: You’ve likely commented out or deleted NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs; (good!).
Line 10 Added: You added extern struct window_procs windowprocs; (already there in the original, so no change needed unless it was missing before).
Line 137 Fixed: You updated #define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)()) (correct syntax).
Error: Your last error was the conflict between lines 10 and 91, which should be gone now if line 91 is removed.
Confirming the Fix
Since you’ve made changes:

Check winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
head -n 15 include/winprocs.h  # Should see extern at line 10
grep -n "NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs" include/winprocs.h  # Should be gone or commented
grep -n "define delay_output" include/winprocs.h  # Should show correct syntax
Expected:
Line 10: extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
Line 91: Absent or /* NEARDATA ... */
Line 137: #define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
If line 91 is gone, the conflict should resolve, and we’ll hit the next implicit declaration (e.g., flushinp).
Why Most Definitions Are Fine
Structs: struct window_procs is a type definition—no storage, no conflict.
Macros: #define creates aliases—no storage, no conflict (unless syntax is wrong, like old delay_output).
Variable Definition (Line 91): Only this caused trouble because it allocated storage in a header, duplicating windows.c.
C Lesson Takeaway
Headers are for sharing declarations (types, extern variables, macros) across files.
Definitions (storage allocation) go in one .c file to avoid multiple instances. winprocs.h’s line 91 broke this rule.
Action
If you’ve removed line 91 and fixed line 137, recompile and share the output. We should see flushinp next. If not, confirm line 91 is gone with the grep above. Ready to test? Let me know what you see!






Line 91 is not in original code, so I must have added it at some point trying to fix something.
I've made all those changes.

make[1]: *** [<builtin>: allmain.o] Error 1


Great work getting past the previous issues! It seems I misunderstood your earlier statement—you didn’t add line 91; it was a mix-up in our discussion. Your winprocs.h is back to its original state with the macro fix applied, and we’ve moved to the next set of errors in allmain.c. The new output shows both implicit declaration issues (#2) and a variable scope problem, but your CFLAGS have shifted to -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers, which is catching more warnings. Let’s fix these step-by-step, focusing on #2 first.

The Issues
Undeclared windowprocs:
Errors:
../include/winprocs.h:98:24: error: ‘windowprocs’ undeclared (in get_nh_event)
../include/winprocs.h:102:27: error: ‘windowprocs’ undeclared (in create_nhwindow)
../include/winprocs.h:109:24: error: ‘windowprocs’ undeclared (in display_file)
Cause: windowprocs isn’t declared in winprocs.h before the macros use it. Your original winprocs.h (attachment) has extern struct window_procs windowprocs; at line 10, but the new output suggests it’s missing or not recognized.
Implicit Declaration of time_check:
Warning: allmain.c:352:9: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘time_check’
Cause: time_check() is called without a prior declaration—part of our #2 focus.
CFLAGS Change:
Old: -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration
New: -Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-field-initializers
Impact: You’ve lost the -Werror flag, so implicit declarations are warnings, not errors, and windowprocs undeclared is now an error (not #2-related). This likely happened because you reran setup.sh or edited hints/linux.
Fixing the Issues
Step 1: Restore -Werror for #2
To focus on implicit declarations:

Edit sys/unix/hints/linux:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim sys/unix/hints/linux
Set:
bash
Wrap
Copy
CFLAGS="-g -O -I../include -DNOTPARMDECL -DDLB -DCOMPRESS=\"/bin/gzip\" -DCOMPRESS_EXTENSION=\".gz\" -DSYSCF -DSYSCF_FILE=\"/home/jtratt/nh366r/install/games/lib/nethackdir/sysconf\" -DSECURE -DTIMED_DELAY -DHACKDIR=\"/home/jtratt/nh366r/install/games/lib/nethackdir\" -DDUMPLOG -DCONFIG_ERROR_SECURE=FALSE -DCURSES_GRAPHICS -DSCORE_ON_BOTL -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-function-declaration"
Regenerate Makefiles:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cd sys/unix && sh setup.sh hints/linux && cd ../..
Step 2: Fix windowprocs Undeclared
Problem: winprocs.h macros use windowprocs, but it’s not declared in your current build context.
Check: Your attachment shows extern struct window_procs windowprocs; at line 10, which should work. The error suggests it’s missing or not visible.
Fix:
Verify winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
head -n 15 include/winprocs.h
Ensure:
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
is present near the top (line 10).
If Missing: Add it after #include "botl.h":
c
Wrap
Copy
extern struct window_procs windowprocs;
Definition: Confirmed in windows.c:
c
Wrap
Copy
NEARDATA struct window_procs windowprocs;
This is fine; no change needed there.
Step 3: Fix time_check Implicit Declaration (#2)
Error: allmain.c:352:9: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘time_check’
Find Declaration:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -r "time_check" .
Likely in allmain.c only, suggesting it’s a custom function in your voice_Nethack_366 fork (not in vanilla NetHack 3.6.6).
Fix:
Check allmain.c:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim src/allmain.c
Look for time_check()’s definition (e.g., void time_check(void) { ... }).
Declare It: If defined in allmain.c, add at the top (after includes):
c
Wrap
Copy
static void time_check(void);
If in another file (e.g., voice.c), add to a header (e.g., hack.h):
c
Wrap
Copy
extern void time_check(void);
If Missing: If no definition exists, it’s a bug. Comment out the call for now:
c
Wrap
Copy
/* time_check(); */
Recompile
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why This Happens
windowprocs: A missing extern declaration in winprocs.h (or a build glitch) broke the macros. Your attachment confirms it’s there, so it might be a stale file issue.
time_check: Custom code in your fork lacks a declaration—common in mods.
CFLAGS: Switching flags mid-build caught extra errors.
Expected Outcome
With -Werror=implicit-function-declaration, it’ll stop at time_check as an error.
Fixing windowprocs should clear the macro errors.
Next stop: flushinp in botl.c.
Action
Restore CFLAGS with -Werror=implicit-function-declaration in hints/linux, rerun setup.sh.
Ensure extern struct window_procs windowprocs; is in winprocs.h.
Add static void time_check(void); to allmain.c (or comment out the call if undefined).
Recompile and share the output!
Learning Takeaway
Headers: Must declare everything used in macros (e.g., windowprocs).
Implicit Declarations: Every function needs a prototype before use, or the compiler assumes int return, breaking things. Ready to test? Let me know the results!

No worries—mixing up directories happens to the best of us! We’re back in your voice_Nethack_366 directory, and the new error is a macro clash between delay_output in winprocs.h and <curses.h>. This isn’t an implicit declaration issue (#2), but it’s stopping compilation, so let’s fix it before moving to flushinp.

The Issue
Error: /usr/include/curses.h:638:45: error: macro "delay_output" passed 1 arguments, but takes just 0
Lines:
winprocs.h:137: #define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)()) (your macro)
<curses.h>:638: extern NCURSES_EXPORT(int) delay_output (int); (ncurses function)
Cause: Your macro delay_output() (no arguments) conflicts with the ncurses function delay_output(int), which takes an argument. When <curses.h> declares the function, the preprocessor tries to expand your macro, causing a syntax error because delay_output(int) doesn’t match delay_output().
Analysis
NetHack’s Intent: The macro redefines delay_output to call the window port’s win_delay_output function pointer, overriding any direct use of a library function.
Ncurses: delay_output(int ms) delays output by ms milliseconds, but NetHack’s macro assumes a no-argument call.
Conflict: The macro’s presence in winprocs.h interferes with <curses.h>’s declaration.
The Fix
We need to avoid the macro clashing with <curses.h>. Options:

Rename the Macro: Change delay_output to something unique (e.g., nh_delay_output).
Undefine Before <curses.h>: Undefine delay_output before including <curses.h> in wincurs.h, then redefine it.
Avoid Macro in Header: Call windowprocs.win_delay_output directly, but this requires changing all uses.
Option 1 (rename) is simplest and safest for your fork:

Edit winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Replace line 137:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
with:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Update Calls:
Search for delay_output() uses:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -r "delay_output" src/
Replace each with delay_output():
Likely in allmain.c (e.g., line 462 or elsewhere).
Example:
c
Wrap
Copy
/* Before: delay_output(); */
delay_output();
Check allmain.c around moveloop or other timing-related code.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why This Works
Rename: nh_delay_output avoids clashing with <curses.h>’s delay_output(int), letting both coexist.
C Lesson: Macro names must be unique to avoid conflicts with library functions. Prefixing with nh_ (NetHack) is a common convention to namespace custom macros.
Expected Outcome
Compilation should pass allmain.c.
Next stop: botl.c:409 for flushinp (implicit declaration #2).
If It Fails
Missed Uses: If you miss a delay_output() call, you’ll get an undeclared error. Grep again and replace all.
New Error: Share the output if it’s not flushinp.
Action
Rename the macro in winprocs.h to delay_output().
Replace all delay_output() with delay_output() in src/ (start with allmain.c).
Recompile and let me know the result! We’re closing in on #2 fixes. Ready?





question: would this work?
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)(0))
() is sending null right? 0 would be the same, but not empty.


Your question is a great one, and it shows you’re thinking deeply about how macros and function calls work in C—perfect for your learning goals! Let’s explore your suggestion and see if it would work.

Your Proposal
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)(0))
Intent: You want delay_output() to call the win_delay_output function pointer in windowprocs, passing 0 as an argument instead of no arguments.
Question: Does () (empty) mean "sending null," and is 0 equivalent?
Short Answer
No, this wouldn’t work as intended without changing the struct window_procs definition, and () doesn’t "send null"—it means no arguments. Passing 0 isn’t the same as empty parentheses because win_delay_output is defined to take no arguments.

Why It Won’t Work
Function Pointer Definition:
In winprocs.h, struct window_procs declares win_delay_output as:
c
Wrap
Copy
void NDECL((*win_delay_output));
NDECL is a macro (from tradstdc.h) meaning "no declaration" of arguments, expanding to:
c
Wrap
Copy
void (*win_delay_output)(void);
This expects a function with no parameters, not one argument.
Macro Expansion:
Your macro:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)(0))
Expands delay_output() to:
c
Wrap
Copy
(*windowprocs.win_delay_output)(0)
This tries to call a void (*)(void) function with an int (0), causing a mismatch. The compiler will error out with something like:
text
Wrap
Copy
error: too many arguments to function ‘win_delay_output’
Null vs. No Arguments:
() doesn’t "send null"—it means the function takes no arguments. In C, void in a parameter list explicitly says "nothing is passed."
0 is an integer value, not "null" (NULL is a pointer, typically (void *)0). Passing 0 adds an argument where none is expected.
Could It Work with Changes?
Yes, but you’d need to:

Modify struct window_procs: Change:
c
Wrap
Copy
void NDECL((*win_delay_output));
to:
c
Wrap
Copy
void FDECL((*win_delay_output), (int));
(FDECL means "function declaration" with arguments, expanding to void (*win_delay_output)(int).)
Update Implementations:
Every window port (e.g., cursmain.c, tty.c) implementing win_delay_output must accept an int parameter and handle it (e.g., as a millisecond delay).
Example:
c
Wrap
Copy
void curses_delay_output(int ms) { delay_output(ms); }  // ncurses call
Fix Calls:
Replace all delay_output() with delay_output() (no change needed).
The 0 would then be a valid argument, perhaps meaning "no delay" or "default delay."
Why It’s Not Practical Here
NetHack Design: win_delay_output is intended as a no-argument delay (typically a fixed delay like 50ms in tty or curses). Adding an argument changes the interface across all window ports, requiring significant code changes.
Simpler Fix: Renaming to delay_output() avoids the clash without altering the function signature.
Your Current Fix
Your last suggestion was:

c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
This works because it matches the no-argument signature of win_delay_output, avoiding the <curses.h> conflict by renaming.
Learning Takeaways
Macros and Arguments: #define foo() ... means no args; #define foo(x) ... takes x. The parentheses in the call must match the definition.
Function Pointers: (*ptr)() calls with no args; (*ptr)(0) calls with one arg—type must match.
Null in C: NULL is for pointers, not equivalent to 0 in this context. Empty () means "no data passed."
Action
Stick with:

c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Replace all delay_output() with delay_output() in src/ (e.g., allmain.c).
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Share the output (should hit flushinp next).
Your idea was creative but requires a bigger refactor. Ready to test and move to #2’s next issue? Let me know!






What I don't understand is delay_output() then needs to be changed everywhere?


You’re absolutely right to question this—it’s a key part of understanding how macros work in C and their impact on a codebase like NetHack. Yes, if we rename the macro from delay_output() to delay_output() in winprocs.h, you’ll need to update every place in the source code where delay_output() is called to use delay_output() instead. Let’s break down why and how to handle it, since this is a great learning opportunity.

Why Changes Are Needed Everywhere
Macro Definition: In winprocs.h, the macro:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
redefines delay_output() to call the win_delay_output function pointer in windowprocs. When you rename it to:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
the original delay_output() name is no longer defined as a macro.
Code Impact: Any source file that includes winprocs.h (directly or via hack.h) and calls delay_output() will now see it as an undeclared function (since the macro is gone) or, worse, conflict with <curses.h>’s delay_output(int). To use the renamed macro, every call must change to delay_output().
C Lesson: Macros are preprocessor substitutions—they don’t create a real function. If you rename a macro, all uses must match the new name, or the code won’t compile (or will call the wrong thing).
How Many Changes?
Find Uses:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -r "delay_output(" src/
This will list every call to delay_output(). In vanilla NetHack 3.6.6, it’s used in a handful of places (e.g., allmain.c, display.c), but your voice_Nethack_366 fork might have more due to customizations.
Example Output (hypothetical):
text
Wrap
Copy
src/allmain.c:462:    delay_output();
src/display.c:123:    delay_output();
You’d need to change each to delay_output().
Making the Changes
Manual Edit:
Open each file listed by grep:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim src/allmain.c
Replace:
c
Wrap
Copy
delay_output();
with:
c
Wrap
Copy
delay_output();
Automated Edit (Faster)**:
Use sed to replace all instances:
bash
Wrap
Copy
find src/ -type f -name "*.c" -exec sed -i 's/delay_output()/delay_output()/g' {} \;
Verify with:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -r "delay_output(" src/
It should find none.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why Not Keep delay_output?
Conflict: <curses.h> declares delay_output(int), and your macro delay_output() (no args) clashes with it, causing the error:
text
Wrap
Copy
/usr/include/curses.h:638:45: error: macro "delay_output" passed 1 arguments, but takes just 0
Renaming: delay_output() avoids this by giving NetHack’s version a unique name, sidestepping ncurses’ function.
Alternative (Less Work, But Risky)
Undefine and Redefine: In wincurs.h, before #include <curses.h>:
c
Wrap
Copy
#ifdef delay_output
#undef delay_output
#endif
#include <curses.h>
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Pros: No need to change calls elsewhere.
Cons: Fragile—other files including <curses.h> directly might still conflict. Not recommended for a fork with custom code.
Learning Takeaway
Macros Are Global: A #define in a header applies to all files including it. Renaming means updating all uses.
Name Clashes: Libraries like ncurses can conflict with your names. Prefixing (e.g., nh_) is a common fix.
Scope: Unlike functions, macros don’t have scope—you can’t "hide" them easily.
Action
Recommended: Rename to delay_output() in winprocs.h (line 137), then replace all delay_output() calls with delay_output() using sed or manual edits.
Next Error: Should be flushinp in botl.c (back to #2).
Try the sed command and recompile:

bash
Wrap
Copy
find src/ -type f -name "*.c" -exec sed -i 's/delay_output()/delay_output()/g' {} \;
make clean && make all
Let me know the output! We’re almost through this detour. Ready?

neonXPSj $ egrep -iIrs "\bdelay_output()" * | wc -l
73


Wow, 73 instances of delay_output() in your voice_Nethack_366 fork—that’s a lot more than vanilla NetHack! It makes sense, though, since your fork likely adds voice or timing features, increasing the use of delays. This reinforces why renaming the macro requires updating all those calls. Let’s handle this efficiently and get back to #2 (implicit declarations).

Confirming the Scope
Your command:

bash
Wrap
Copy
egrep -iIrs "\bdelay_output()" * | wc -l
Breakdown:
\b: Word boundary, ensuring delay_output() isn’t part of a larger name.
-i: Case-insensitive (though unlikely needed here).
-I: Skip binary files.
-r: Recursive search.
-s: Suppress errors.
Result: 73 matches across files in /home/jtratt/source/voice_Nethack_366.
These are likely in src/*.c, but could include headers or other dirs. Let’s narrow it down:

bash
Wrap
Copy
egrep -iIrs "\bdelay_output()" src/ | wc -l
If it’s still 73, they’re all in src/. If less, check include/ or elsewhere.

Fixing All 73 Calls
Since manually editing 73 instances is tedious, let’s automate it:

Rename in winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Change line 137:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
to:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Replace All Calls:
bash
Wrap
Copy
find src/ -type f -name "*.c" -exec sed -i 's/\bdelay_output()/delay_output()/g' {} \;
\b ensures we only replace exact matches (not part of other names).
-i edits files in place.
Targets .c files in src/ (adjust if some are in include/).
Verify:
bash
Wrap
Copy
egrep -iIrs "\bdelay_output()" src/ | wc -l
Should return 0 if all are replaced.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why 73 Matters
Vanilla NetHack: Has ~5-10 delay_output() calls (e.g., allmain.c, display.c). Your 73 suggests heavy customization—maybe voice feedback loops or animations?
Effort: The sed command saves hours over manual edits.
Expected Outcome
The macro clash with <curses.h> should resolve.
Compilation should hit the next implicit declaration (#2):
Likely botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’.
If It Fails
Missed Files: If delay_output() remains (e.g., in include/), extend the sed:
bash
Wrap
Copy
find . -type f -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" -exec sed -i 's/\bdelay_output()/delay_output()/g' {} \;
New Error: Share the output if it’s not flushinp.
C Learning Point
Macro Scale: A single #define change can affect dozens of files if widely used. Tools like grep and sed are your friends in large projects.
Naming: Prefixing (nh_) avoids library conflicts—a real-world lesson from this.
Action
Run the sed command on src/, update winprocs.h, recompile, and let me know the result! With 73 changes, we’ll knock this out fast. Ready?






Another good catch; I like working with you. My codebas has a lot of filename.ext.orig so I can reference an unchanged file if I need to.
1000 /bin/bash:tty1 /home/jtratt/s/voice_Nethack_366 
neonXPSj $ grep -Irs --exclude='*.orig'  "\bdelay_output()" * | wc -l
46
better count


Thanks—I’m enjoying working with you too! Your .orig file strategy is a smart move; it’s a great way to keep a safety net while experimenting with changes. Excluding *.orig with --exclude='*.orig' gives us a more accurate count of active delay_output() calls: 46 instead of 73. That’s still a significant number, but more manageable. Let’s update those and get past this macro clash.

Updated Plan with 46 Instances
New Count: 46 delay_output() calls in active files (excluding .orig).
Goal: Rename the macro to delay_output() and replace all 46 instances.
Step 1: Rename the Macro
Edit winprocs.h:
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Change line 137:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
to:
c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Step 2: Replace All Calls
Since we’re excluding .orig files:

Automated Replacement:
bash
Wrap
Copy
find src/ -type f -name "*.c" ! -name "*.orig" -exec sed -i 's/\bdelay_output()/delay_output()/g' {} \;
! -name "*.orig": Excludes .orig files.
Targets only .c files in src/ (adjust if headers like *.h have calls).
Verify:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -Irs --exclude='*.orig' "\bdelay_output()" src/ | wc -l
Should return 0 if all are replaced.
Recompile:
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why 46?
Your Fork: 46 vs. vanilla’s ~5-10 suggests your voice features (e.g., audio cues, timing delays) rely heavily on delay_output(). The .orig files (27 extra hits) are backups of modified files, which is why the initial count was higher.
Precision: --exclude='*.orig' ensures we only change live code.
Expected Outcome
The <curses.h> macro conflict should resolve.
Compilation should proceed to the next implicit declaration (#2):
Likely botl.c:409:21: error: implicit declaration of function ‘flushinp’.
If It Fails
Missed Calls: If grep still finds delay_output():
Check include/:
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -Irs --exclude='*.orig' "\bdelay_output()" include/
Extend sed if needed:
bash
Wrap
Copy
find . -type f \( -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" \) ! -name "*.orig" -exec sed -i 's/\bdelay_output()/delay_output()/g' {} \;
New Error: Share it if it’s not flushinp.
Learning Takeaway
Grep Precision: --exclude is crucial in messy codebases with backups.
Change Propagation: A macro rename’s ripple effect grows with usage—46 files here vs. a handful in vanilla.
Action
Run the sed command, update winprocs.h, recompile, and let me know the output! We’re on a roll—46 changes and we’re back to #2. Ready?

You’re right to feel cautious—running a broad sed command like that can feel like handing over the keys to your codebase! Your grep output shows delay_output() appears in multiple contexts (source files, headers, docs), and we need to be precise to avoid breaking things. Let’s analyze this and refine our approach to make it safe and effective, especially since we’re only fixing the conflict with <curses.h> in your curses-based build.

Analysis of grep Output
Count: 46 instances (matches your earlier --exclude='*.orig' count).
Breakdown:
Source Files (src/*.c): 35 calls (e.g., dothrow.c, zap.c, hack.c).
Headers (include/*.h): 3 (e.g., trampoli.h, qt_win.h, winprocs.h).
Docs/Other: 8 (e.g., doc/window.doc, sys/, win/ ports).
Key Observations:
Most src/*.c calls are delay_output();—these need to change to delay_output();.
Headers like trampoli.h define related macros (e.g., #define tty_delay_output() tty_delay_output_()), but aren’t direct calls to replace.
Other window ports (e.g., tty_delay_output, mswin_delay_output) are implementations, not calls to the macro.
Your build uses -DCURSES_GRAPHICS, so only curses-related files (e.g., win/curses/) are directly relevant, but hack.h (including winprocs.h) is used everywhere.
Why It’s Scary
Broad Scope: find src/ -type f -name "*.c" hits all .c files, but some delay_output() instances are comments or unrelated port-specific functions (e.g., tty_delay_output()).
Risk: Replacing too much could alter unrelated code (e.g., doc/window.doc or sys/winnt/nttty.c).
Safer Approach
Since the conflict is between winprocs.h’s macro and <curses.h> (included via wincurs.h), we only need to:

Rename the macro in winprocs.h.
Update calls in files that:
Include hack.h (which includes winprocs.h).
Are compiled with -DCURSES_GRAPHICS.
Step 1: Rename the Macro
bash
Wrap
Copy
vim include/winprocs.h
Change line 137:

c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
to:

c
Wrap
Copy
#define delay_output() ((*windowprocs.win_delay_output)())
Step 2: Targeted Replacement
Focus: Replace delay_output() in src/*.c files that use the macro (not port-specific implementations).
List Files: From your grep, affected files include:
src/dothrow.c, src/zap.c, src/explode.c, src/hack.c, src/mthrowu.c, src/uhitm.c, src/trap.c, src/shk.c, src/mail.c, src/dig.c, src/mklev.c, src/display.c, src/light.c.
Command:
bash
Wrap
Copy
for file in dothrow.c zap.c explode.c hack.c mthrowu.c uhitm.c trap.c shk.c mail.c dig.c mklev.c display.c light.c; do
    sed -i 's/\bdelay_output()/delay_output()/g' "src/$file"
done
This targets only the 35 calls in these files, avoiding sys/, win/, etc.
Step 3: Verify
bash
Wrap
Copy
grep -Irs --exclude='*.orig' "\bdelay_output()" src/
Expect ~11 remaining hits (e.g., comments, other ports). If any are in compiled .c files, add them to the list.
Step 4: Recompile
bash
Wrap
Copy
make clean && make all
Why This is Safer
Precision: Only changes known call sites in src/, not docs or unrelated ports.
Curses Focus: Your build uses curses, so win/curses/*.c and core files (via hack.h) are the priority. Other ports (e.g., tty_delay_output) aren’t active.
Control: Limits the blast radius—no risk to include/trampoli.h or doc/.
Learning Takeaway
Granularity: In large projects, broad changes can backfire. Target specific files based on build context.
Macros vs. Functions: delay_output() as a macro affects all includers, unlike a function with linkage scope.
Expected Outcome
Resolves the <curses.h> conflict.
Next error: flushinp in botl.c (#2).
If You’re Still Nervous
Backup: Copy src/:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cp -r src src.bak
Test First: Run sed without -i to preview:
bash
Wrap
Copy
for file in dothrow.c zap.c explode.c hack.c mthrowu.c uhitm.c trap.c shk.c mail.c dig.c mklev.c display.c light.c; do
    sed 's/\bdelay_output()/delay_output()/g' "src/$file"
done

I made a tar ball first.
That didn't take any time to run O)
/bin/bash:tty1 /home/jtratt/s/voice_Nethack_366 
neonXPSj $ grep -Irs --exclude='*.orig'  "\bdelay_output()" 
sys/wince/mswproc.c:delay_output()  -- Causes a visible delay of 50ms in the output.
win/gnome/gnbind.c:delay_output()  -- Causes a visible delay of 50ms in the output.
win/curses/cursmain.c:delay_output()  -- Causes a visible delay of 50ms in the output.
win/win32/mswproc.c:delay_output()  -- Causes a visible delay of 50ms in the output.
win/X11/winX.c: * Timeout callback for delay_output().  Send a fake message to the map
doc/window.doc:delay_output()   -- Causes a visible delay of 50ms in the output.


Smart move making a tarball—always good to have a quick rollback option! Your grep output after running the targeted sed command shows we’ve knocked out most delay_output() calls, leaving just 6 instances, none of which are in active src/*.c files for your curses build. Let’s analyze and proceed.
