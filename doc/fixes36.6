produce 3.6.6 as well as any post-release fixes in binaries.


General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
invalid status highlight color could be maliciously used to corrupt memory
formatting corpse names used internal buffers differently from formatting
	other objects and could potentially clobber memory
avoid divide by 0 crash if 'bogusmon' (file of bogus monster types) is empty
avoid #wizrumorcheck crash if either 'rumors.tru' or 'rumors.fal' or both
	were empty when makedefs built 'rumors'
avoid "<mon>'s glorkum pass harmlessly through the shade" for weaponless mon
avoid pets blocking staircases: using an 'm' prefix on a stair/ladder square
with a peaceful pet now prints "Pardon me" and nudges the pet one square
away (ensuring it is no longer adjacent) so the hero can go up/down without
having the pet follow or block the stairs next turn


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
teach unix/Makefile.doc how to make Guidebook.dat, an unpaginated copy of
	Guidebook.txt
